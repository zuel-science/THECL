In this paper, we propose a novel framework called THECL to address the challenge of generating positive and negative samples in self-supervised learning for HINs. We specifically design a meta-path-based subgraph generation method and combine it with a triplet network for contrastive learning. Additionally, we incorporate a MoCo-like mechanism, which enhances the differentiation between positive and negative samples by delaying parameter updates between the target and online networks. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of THECL across various tasks.
